            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſhall gloſſe upon the letter of the words, and give you what I conceive to be the minde of the holy Ghoſt in them, and then raiſe doctrinal concluſions out of them. For the opening of the words, I will propound and anſwer, <hi>Theſe five Queries:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Q.</hi> What it is to <hi>dye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture mentioneth, 1. A death <hi>in</hi> ſin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. 2. A death <hi>to</hi> ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. 3. A death <hi>for</hi> ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. The firſt is proper to the unregenerate. The ſecond is proper to the regenerate. The laſt, if you underſtand it of eternal death, is only the portion of reprobates; if of a temporal death, is the lot both of the wicked and the godly. Spiritual death is the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the image of God, holineſſe and righteouſneſſe from the ſoul; temporal death is a ſeparation of the ſoul from the body; eternal death is a ſeparation of ſoul and body from a ſight of the face of God for ever. The death I ſhall diſcourſe is temporal or corporal; and thus [as I hinted before] <hi>to die</hi> is to have the knot untyed, the union diſſolved between ſoul and body. As for God to depart from the ſoul is the death of it; ſo for the ſoul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the body is the death of it. <hi>Rachels ſoul departing, ſhee died,</hi> Gen. 35.18.</p>

The <hi>ſpecial</hi> reaſons aſſigned are theſe: For <hi>Enochs</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, God hereby [in the very non-age of the world and infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Church] would give the faithfull Patriarchs a document of the reſurrection and life eternal. It may be thus made out: the firſt man that dyed was a martyr, and dyed for religion; now as in <hi>Abels death</hi> they were taught to prepare for ſufferings, ſo in <hi>Enochs tranſlation</hi> they were taught a leſſon of the happineſſe of the glorified eſtate which would make amends for all. And you may obſerve <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.4, 5. preſently after the Apoſtles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> hee mentions this tranſlation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> giving notice in both of the different fruit of holineſſe in reſpect <hi>of God</hi> and <hi>evil men;</hi> by men it is perſecuted even to death, by God rewarded even to everlaſting life.

            </p>
            <p>I aſſume theſe in order:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doctr. <hi>Death is a ſtated appointed buſineſs.</hi> Job 14.5, 6. <hi>ſeeing his daies are determined, the number of his moneths are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds that hee cannot paſſe. Turn from him that hee may reſt, till he have accompliſhed as an hireling his day.</hi> Not only becauſe mans time is full of travel and labour, but becauſe hee works for a ſet time, hee is likened to an hireling. Our death, the time of our death, the kinde of it, the manner of it, that wee ſhall dye, when wee ſhall dye, how wee ſhall dye, how long wee ſhall be dying; whether wee ſhall be taken off the ſtage in infancy, youth, or old age by a natural or violent death; whether wee ſhall take a ſhort ſtep to our long home, or walk through a long and dark entry of tedious ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and lingring diſeaſes to the black hall of the king of terrours, all theſe fall under the decree and appointment of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inferences</hi> from the point are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Inf.</hi> Wee ſhould reckon upon death, the decree of God<note n="*" place="margin">Voluntas Dei neceſſitas rei.</note> carries all before it. Job 30.23. <hi>I know that thou wilt bring mee death, and to the houſe appointed for all living.</hi> Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that by men are appointed to dye, God <hi>by the greatneſs of his power can preſerve,</hi> Pſal. 79.11. and <hi>looſe,</hi> Pſal. 102.20. but if God hath appointed one to dye at ſuch a time, all the men up, on earth cannot reſcue him. <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon had a young monitor that came every day and ſaluted him with this antheme of mortality, <hi>Philippe mortalis es, Philippe mortalis

               </note> Our dayes are numbred with God, and let us ſay as Pſal. 90.12. <hi>Teach us ſo to number our dayes that wee may apply our hearts to wiſedom.</hi> True wiſedom of improving our dayes begins at numbring our dayes, and this wiſedom is not learnt but by God his teaching. God keeps reckoning for us, but wee ſhould in a ſpiritual way be reckoning of them our ſ lves on this manner, I cannot live alway, I ſhall not live long. O let mee live well. Job 16.22. <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way whence I ſhall not return;</hi> not return by any power of nature, not return again to the ſtate of nature.</p>

               <hi>weep for her,</hi> Gen. 23.2. Grace doth not come to deſtroy nature but to rectifie it. 2. To be inſenſible of the hand of God in it is ſinfull. It is an heatheniſh ſin to be <hi>without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection,</hi> Rom. 1.31. and it is a charg drawn up againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> Hoſ. 7.11. <hi>hee is like a ſilly dove, without heart.</hi> Only the dove laments not when her young are taken away.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118885:15"/> ſcraping ſtill. 3. If you keep up the lawfulneſſe of the thing, and keep out the ſinfulneſſe of it, your care muſt be, that natural affections do not hinder the exerciſe of gracious diſpoſitions. Wee muſt not weep out the eye of faith, <hi>nor ſorrow without hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nec ſicci ſint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi nec fluant.</note> 1 Theſſ. 4.13. you may water your plants but not drown them. <hi>They wept,</hi> yet ſaid, <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> Acts 21.13, 14. 4. Yet ſometimes the affections of the beſt Saints have been too ſtrong for their judgments, and ſtrangely overflow'd all banks and bounds of reaſon and moderation. When <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon a ſight of the bloody coat, ſuppoſed an evil beaſt had devoured Joſeph,—<hi>he refuſed to be comforted, and he ſaid, I will go down into the grave unto my ſon, mourning,</hi> Gen. 37.33, 35.

               <hi>ſon,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. 5. The great cauſe of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate grief is inordinate love. If our love be too much, our grief will be overmuch. The exceſſe of one affection turns into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of another, [as the ſweeteſt wine degenerates into the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt vinegar]. <hi>Jacob</hi> doted too much upon <hi>Joſeph. David</hi> was too fond of <hi>Abſalom.</hi> It is the Apoſtles rule, that <hi>they that have wives</hi> [and it holds as true of children] <hi>be as though they had none,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29. Wee muſt uſe periſhing things with periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections, love them as alwaies about to leave them. Outward things muſt hang looſe, like outward garments which wee can ſoon lay aſide. If the heart was but weaned, and wee had buried our friends alive [that is acted over their deaths afore-hand in our own thoughts] it would be ſuch an amazing aſtoniſhing thing to part with them when God calls for them. 6. Having pointed at the cauſe, I will attempt the cure of this diſtemper, by laying down a few <hi>Conſiderations</hi> that may calm our diſcontents and quiet our mindes, when God ſhall take away the ſweeteſt flower out of the noſe-gay of our creature comforts. 1. <hi>Hee</hi> doth it that beſt may. <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him, for hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118885:16"/> giveth not account of any of his matters?</hi> Job 33.13, 2. <hi>Hee</hi> taketh away nothing but what he firſt gave. 3. <hi>When</hi> he giveth any thing to us, he doth not relinquiſh his own right. 4. <hi>Iſ ſo</hi> he may call for his own when hee pleaſes. 5. <hi>Hee</hi> takes away nothing but what he will again reſtore, and that a hundred-fold, if not in kinde, yet in worth, making it up ſome wayes in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that is better for thee. 6. <hi>God</hi> may take any thing away from mee in love but his love. 7. <hi>Earthly</hi> things are but indifferent things, and why ſhould not I be indifferently affected to them? Here a little joy and a little ſorrow is enough. <hi>They that rejoyce must be as though they rejoyced not; and they that weep as though they wept not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.30. 8. <hi>It</hi> was God that did comfort mee by the creature, and God is able to comfort mee without it. I lived upon God alone in the uſe, and can I not live upon God alone in loſſe of the creature? My childe, my friend dies, but <hi>the Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my rock, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 89.46.9. <hi>Theſe</hi> worldly comforts are uncertain, but O my ſoul thou art intereſſed in covenant-mercies, that are the ſure mercies of David. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet hee hath made with mee an everlaſting covenant, in all things ordered and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation and all my deſire, although hee make it not to grow,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. 10. <hi>Bluſh</hi> O Chriſtian and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if a principle of the grace of God in thee, do not cauſe thee to do that in obedience to God, which length of time will do; for that will wear off the greateſt croſſe. 11. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> whenſoever the Lord removes any comfort, if wee finde our ſelves ready to ſay to the inſtrument, as did the <hi>Owners of the colt,</hi> what do you <hi>looſing</hi> it? you ſhould be ſilenced, though not with that anſwer which was returned by the diſciples to them, <hi>the Lord hath need of it;</hi> yet with this, the Lord ſees it <hi>needfull for us</hi> that thus it ſhould be. It was ſaid of <hi>Reuben,</hi> hee <hi>went up to his fathers bed,</hi> and ſo the creature intercepts and way-lays the reſpects due to God, and then the ciſtern ſhall be broken, to bring us to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. If a childe have that room in the parents affection which is peculiar to God, though it be a very hopefull childe, God uſes to remove it. As if a wife come once to love a ſervant better than her husband, though hee bee otherwayes a moſt uſefull ſervant, yet the maſter will turn him out of doors. If in the fulneſſe of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118885:16"/> creature-enloyments wee wax wanton and inſolent againſt God, death brings a <hi>voider,</hi> and God bids <hi>take away</hi> thoſe abuſed comforts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.21. —<hi>When I take from them the joy of their glory, the deſire of their eyes, and that whereupon they ſet their mindes, their ſons and their daughters.</hi> If you ſet your minde upon a thing, and the heart once grow to it, look for an unſettlement. You may hug a creature ſo long till you kill it with kindeneſſe. You may ſoon wither your beſt flowers by ſmelling too oft on them. God takes away that from us, which had firſt taken our hearts from him.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118885:27"/> for <hi>theſe ends,</hi> 1. To make up the breach that ſinne had made between God and us. Sin bred a diſtance between God and man, Chriſt died upon this account, to remove that out of the way which hindred their frindly cloſing, and ſo to bring God and man together. <hi>He ſuffered once the juſt for the unjuſt that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. He ſuffered as a publick perſon, as the repreſentative of Gods elect, as a ſurety of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as a ſacrifice, to ſatisfie God and juſtifie us ſinners. Hence he is ſaid in ſcripture to be a <hi>propitiation for ſin, to bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, to be our peace, to make our peace through the blood of the Croſſe:</hi> the places are known. I will urg but that <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. where we are ſaid to be <hi>reconciled to God by the death of his ſon.</hi> 2. To make ſure all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to us which are our great cordials of comfort.

To put the devil out of office, who is the accuſer of the brethren, and to take away thoſe ſlaviſh fears of death that might ariſe from our own guilty conſciences. Heb. 2.14, 15. —<hi>that through death he might d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That blood of Chriſt which ſatisfies God his juſtice, may anſwer all the quarrels of Satan, and ſatisfie all the ſcruples of our own conſcience. We all ſtanding indebted to the Moral Law; herein lay the devils power over us, that he could boldly accuſe us and ſue our bond, but Chriſt by his death hath taken away this power [paying the debt and cancelling the bond] ſo that Satan is now not an <hi>accuſer</hi> but a <hi>ſlanderer.</hi> It is very obſervable how <hi>Old Teſtament Saints</hi> did decline and deprecate death, ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> Pſal. 39.13. <hi>O ſpare me a little, that I may rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Like a crane or a ſwallow ſo did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove.</hi> Whereas on the other ſide <hi>New Teſtament Saints</hi> welcom their departure and wiſh for their diſſolution. Saith <hi>Simeon</hi> Luke 2.29. <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> Saith <hi>Paul</hi> Philip. 1. ver. 23. —<hi>having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt.</hi> You may ſee a <hi>difference,</hi> now the <hi>reaſon</hi> followeth.
